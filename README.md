# Cannabis-Recycle-scanner
We created an original solution to the sustainability problem of cannabis product packaging. We addressed the issue by devising a three-step strategy for resolving it. We went through three steps: taking care of the materials, packaging, and selecting the best packing method. The second thing we wanted to do was go a little further, so we want to transform what packaging means to customers and how they engage with it.You sort of examine the life cycle of something. The third factor is that there must be some form of assistance or incentive in order for people to want to help rescue the world and recycle.  We had two ideas on what kind of material we wanted to utilize. The first was aluminum, which has an endless amount of recycling uses but is expensive to obtain and cannot be customized. The second option, which was also our answer, was to utilize PLA plastic. PLA is an abbreviation for Polylactic Acid. PLA is made from renewable materials such as maize starch or sugar cane and is commonly used in 3D printers. It is also biodegradable if disposed of properly. I want to change the mindset of how packaging is received, more like a collectible. I constructed a weed data-based & scanner program in Python, and using the data, we were able to count the recycled/compostable martial. The system provides scalable options for tracking where the material goes after it is received. The scanner, which I designed, also addresses the issue of not having a uniform naming standard for their product categories. In depth, we discuss categories like hybrid Indicia, hybrid Sativa, and so on. As a customer, I want to know what I'm getting into, so we dug deep into our data, and each strain has its own SKUs. The code effectively tracks every single time someone takes a product to a team to be scanned, and it basically has a counter on how many times we recycle. Again, plastic can only be recycled so many times before it becomes useless. So the scanner maintains track of it, and when it reaches its last recycling point, it needs to go into compost, so you're preserving the integrity of that plastic, you know.  ![image](https://github.com/Phillipj1/Cannabis-Recycle-scanner/assets/122323166/b6c11689-690d-43ac-a261-be2d81c59cef)
